Negative Routing Check Script
=============================
(Manual Verification Logic)

1. V2 Endpoint on Legacy Prefix:
   GET /api/reports/summary
   -> Should be 404 (Not Found) or 405 (Method Not Allowed) because legacy router doesn't have /summary.
   
2. Legacy Endpoint on V2 Prefix:
   GET /api/v2/reports/suppliers
   -> Should be 404 (Not Found) because V2 router doesn't have /suppliers.

STATUS: STRICT ROUTING ENFORCED via app.js separation.
