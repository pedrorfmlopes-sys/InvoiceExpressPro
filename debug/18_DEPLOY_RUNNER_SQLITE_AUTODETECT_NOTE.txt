DEPLOY RUNNER SQLITE AUTO-DETECT NOTE
=======================================
Date: 2025-12-15

Objective:
Make `deploy_runner.js` smarter about finding the SQLite database if `SQLITE_FILENAME` is not explicitly set, reducing configuration errors.

Mechanism:
1. Check `ENV.SQLITE_FILENAME`.
2. If missing, and `DB_CLIENT` is sqlite/sqlite3, scan:
   - `db/database.sqlite` (Primary)
   - `database.sqlite` (Legacy root)
   - `db.sqlite` (Alternative)
   - `data/database.sqlite` (Docker style)
3. If found, use it and log "(Found)".
4. If not found, default to `db/database.sqlite` (will warn later if file missing during backup).
5. Logging: Script now prints full config at startup.

Verification:
- `npm run deploy:dry` output confirms:
  - Configuration block printed.
  - `SQLITE_FILENAME: ...\db\database.sqlite (Not Found)` (or Found, if file exists).
  - Gate execution proceeds.

Status:
AUTO-DETECT IMPLEMENTED & VERIFIED.
