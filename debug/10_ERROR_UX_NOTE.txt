Error UX Implementation Note
==============================

How to Reproduce (Simulation):
1. In `apiClient.js` or `SystemHealthTab.jsx`, temporarily corrupt the valid response using `res.data = {}` before the guard check.
2. Visit System Health tab.

Expected UI:
1. Main Area: "System health check failed (Invalid API Response)." in red.
2. Action: "Retry" button visible.
3. Details: A collapsible "Technical Details (Admin)" section appears.
4. Content: Inside details, seeing `{"endpoint": "...", "keys": []}`.

This ensures admins can identify "Why did it fail?" (API changed? Network error?) without exposing raw data to casual users or cluttering the UI.
