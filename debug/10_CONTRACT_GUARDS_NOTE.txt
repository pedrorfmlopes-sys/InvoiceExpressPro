Contract Guards Implementation Note
===================================

Files Modified:
- [NEW] client/src/utils/contractGuards.js: Contains `ContractError` class and guard functions (`isHealthModulesResponse`, etc.).
- [MOD] client/src/api/apiClient.js: Guard added to `getHealthModules`.
- [MOD] client/src/modules/reportsV2/api.js: Guard added to `getSummary`.
- [MOD] client/src/components/ChartsAll.jsx: Guard added to `getLegacySuppliers` call.
- [MOD] client/src/tabs/ExploreTab.jsx: Guard added to `load` (Excel/Docs).
- [MOD] client/src/tabs/SystemHealthTab.jsx: UI Error handling logic.

Guard Logic:
- Each guard checks for critical shape properties (e.g., `modules` array presence).
- If validation fails, throws `ContractError` with endpoint info and keys received.
- Does NOT log full payload to console (security/privacy).
