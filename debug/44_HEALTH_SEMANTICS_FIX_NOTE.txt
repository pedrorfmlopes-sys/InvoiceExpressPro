# Health Semantics Fix - Delivery Note

Corrected the System Health module logic in `DashboardNew.jsx`.

## Logic Change
- **Previous**: `closed: true` was interpreted as "Closed/Error" (Red).
- **New**: `closed: true` is interpreted as "Stable/Closed for Modification" (Green).
- **New**: `closed: false` is interpreted as "Open/Dev Mode" (Amber).

## UX Improvements
- **Overall Status**: "OPERATIONAL" (Green) if API responds with `ok: true`. "DEGRADED" (Red) otherwise.
- **Fail State**: If the API call fails, a "Connection Failed" message is shown with a **Retry Connection** button.
- **Strict Routing**: Now shown as a neutral/informative badge (e.g., "STRICT MODE" in small text), not as an error.

## Verification
- **Visual**:
  - Stable modules (e.g. Auth, Core) -> Green Dot.
  - Open modules (if any) -> Amber Dot.
- **Automated**:
  - `npm run build:client`: PASS
  - `npm run smoke:ui`: PASS

## Files Changed
- `client/src/tabs/DashboardNew.jsx` (Frontend only)
