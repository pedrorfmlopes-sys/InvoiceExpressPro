===== SECTION: PROBLEM ANALYSIS =====
User reported: "ExploreTab.jsx:5 import DndConfirmModal from '../components/DndConfirmModal'" failure.
Reality: The build failed because 'axios' was not exported from 'shared/ui.jsx' (regression from previous task).
'ExploreTab.jsx' tried to import '{ axios }' from '../shared/ui'.

===== SECTION: ACTUAL FIX =====
1. Fix 'ExploreTab.jsx':
   - Removed 'axios' from import.
   - Imported 'api' from '../api/apiClient'.
   - Replaced 'axios.*' with 'api.*' (patch, post, delete, head).

2. Fix OTHER affected files (identified via grep):
   - TransactionsV2Tab.jsx
   - TeacherTab.jsx
   - ProcessTab.jsx
   - NormalizationTab.jsx
   
   These files also imported 'axios' from 'shared/ui' and were breaking the build.
   They have been refactored to use 'apiClient' correctly.

===== SECTION: DND CONFIRM MODAL =====
Verified:
- File exists: client/src/components/DndConfirmModal.jsx
- Exports default: Yes.
- Import path in ExploreTab: Correct.

The reported error on this line was arguably a side-effect or misinterpretation of the build log which listed ExploreTab.jsx errors.

===== SECTION: VERIFICATION =====
Command: 'cd client && npm run build'
Result: PASSED (Exit code 0)

All missing 'axios' imports resolved.
Rules: "Two Worlds" problem further reduced by this forced refactor.
