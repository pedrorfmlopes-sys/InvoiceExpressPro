System Health UI Implementation
===============================

1. Route/Tab:
   - Path: / (SPA, loaded via Tab)
   - Tab ID: `health`
   - Label: 🏥 System Health

2. Files Created/Modified:
   - [NEW] client/src/tabs/SystemHealthTab.jsx
   - [MOD] client/src/App.jsx (Added tab, import, RBAC filter)
   - [MOD] client/src/api/apiClient.js (Added `getHealthModules`)

3. Validation:
   - Log in as Admin.
   - Verify "🏥 System Health" tab appears in navigation.
   - Click tab.
   - Verify table loads with modules (coreV2, health, etc.).
   - Verify "Closed" and "Strict" badges.
   - Verify "Refresh" button works.
   - Log in as User (non-admin).
   - Verify tab is MOT visible.

4. Backend Dependency:
   - Relies on `GET /api/health/modules` (Implemented in previous mission).
