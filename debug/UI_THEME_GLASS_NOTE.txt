# UI Theme Upgrade - "Glass Dashboard"

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Design System & Tokens
- **File**: `client/src/theme.css`
- **Features**:
  - **Dark/Light Mode**: Full support with radial gradients for dark mode and soft linear gradients for light.
  - **Palettes**: 3 "Accent Sets" implemented via CSS variables:
    - `teal` (Default, Premium)
    - `blue` (Corporate)
    - `mono` (Minimalist/Grayscale)
  - **Glassmorphism**: `.glass-panel` class with `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)` and semi-transparent backgrounds.

### 2. Layout Components
- `client/src/components/layout/AppShell.jsx`: Main grid layout (Sidebar Fixed + Main Content).
- `client/src/components/layout/Sidebar.jsx`: Navigation with active state "glow" and pill designs.
- `client/src/components/layout/Topbar.jsx`: Contains Search, User Profile, Project Selector, Theme Toggle, and Accent Selector.

### 3. UI Components
- `client/src/components/ui/GlassCard.jsx`: Reusable container with glass effect.
- `client/src/components/ui/StatCard.jsx`: Metric card with support for accent gradients.

### 4. Integration (App.jsx)
- Wrapped application in `<AppShell>`.
- Replaced `ReportsTab` with new `DashboardNew` (`client/src/tabs/DashboardNew.jsx`).
- **Persistence**: `theme` and `accent` are saved to `localStorage`.
- **Routes**: No routes were removed. Existing tabs (Transactions, CoreV2, Health) render inside the new shell content area.

## Usage
- **Switch Theme**: Click the Sun/Moon icon in the Topbar.
- **Change Palette**: Use the "Teal / Blue / Mono" dropdown in the Topbar.
- **Dashboard**: The default view is now the Dashboard with Stat Cards and Charts.

## Verification
- `npm run build:client` passed successfully.
- Existing logic (Auth, API) preserved.
