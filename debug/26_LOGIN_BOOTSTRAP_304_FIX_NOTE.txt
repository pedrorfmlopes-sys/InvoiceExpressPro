# LOGIN/BOOTSTRAP FIX (Frontend Only)

## Problem Address
- The app was freezing after login or refresh due to a race condition with 304 (Not Modified) responses where Axios received empty bodies for `/api/auth/me`.
- Also, `Promise.all` failure in `checkAuth` caused immediate logout/flash.

## Fix Implemented

### 1. Robust Bootstrap in `App.jsx`
- **Removed `Promise.all`**: Checks user first, then projects.
- **Fail-Safe Checks**: Validates `meRes.data.user` exists before crashing.
- **Retry Logic**: If `/me` fails (e.g., 304 or Network), it retries ONCE with a cache-buster logic.
- **Boot States**:
  - `loading`: Shows a sleek pulsating loading screen.
  - `error`: Shows a clear error message with a **Retry** button (instead of logging out).
  - `ready`: Renders the AppShell.

### 2. Anti-Cache in `apiClient.js`
- Added Request Interceptors to enforce:
  ```
  Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate
  Pragma: no-cache
  Expires: 0
  ```
- This prevents modern browsers (and IE/Edge) from aggressively caching API JSON responses, reducing 304 occurrences.

### 3. Graceful Failure for Secondary Data
- If `/api/projects` fails, it logs a warning but allows the user to proceed (with empty project list).

## Verification
1. **Build**: `npm run build:client` PASS.
2. **Manual Test Spec**:
   - Login -> Should see "Loading Gravity..." then Dashboard.
   - Refresh -> Should recover session gracefully.
   - Network Failure -> Should see "Connection Issue" panel with [Retry] button.

No backend changes were required.
