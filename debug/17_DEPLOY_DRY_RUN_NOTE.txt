MICRO-PATCH NOTE: REAL GATE IN DRY RUN
========================================
Date: 2025-12-15

Objective:
Ensure `npm run deploy:dry` actually runs the Verification Gate (`npm run gate:release`) to validate the build and tests, while continuing to only SIMULATE destructive steps (Backup, Install, Migrate, Restart).

Changes:
- Modified `scripts/deploy_runner.js`:
  - `runCommand` accepts optional `forceRun` parameter.
  - `stepGate` calls `runCommand('npm run gate:release', false, true)`.

Verification:
- `npm run deploy:dry` output confirms:
  - "Executing: npm run gate:release" (Real execution)
  - Gate checks passed (Exit Code 0).
  - Subsequent steps logged as "(DRY) Would execute..." or "(DRY) Would copy...".

Result:
Deploy Dry Run now provides high confidence by verifying the codebase state actually passes checks before simulating the deployment logistics.

Status:
PATCHED & VERIFIED.
