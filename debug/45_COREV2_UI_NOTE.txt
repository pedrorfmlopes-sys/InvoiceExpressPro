# Core V2 UI Upgrade - Delivery Note

UI transformation of the Core V2 tab into a Glass Dashboard layout.

## Modern Layout (3-Card System)
1. **Upload & Process (Top Left)**:
   - Dedicated GlassCard with clearer Dropzone instructions.
   - Distinct "Processing" state with visual feedback.
    
2. **Quick Actions (Top Right)**:
   - Compact Actions card for "Refresh" and "Export All".
   - Consistent `.btn` styling.

3. **Explore Docs (Bottom / Full Width)**:
   - **Filters**: Sticky header with Search, Status, and DocType filters.
   - **Table**: Zebra striping, hover effects, and clean typography.
   - **Empty State**: Friendly "No documents found" message with a "Upload Files" CTA button that focuses/opens the dropzone.

## UX Improvements (Extras)
- **Consistent Icons**: Small, clean icon buttons for table actions (Edit, Link, Finalize).
- **Disabled Feedback**: If actions (like Finalize) are disabled, the checkmark is dimmed and provides a tooltip explanation (e.g., "Missing Doc Type").
- **Bulk Actions**: Appears contextually when items are selected, with a pulsing glass effect.

## Verification
- **Build**: `npm run build:client` ✅ PASS
- **Smoke**: `npm run smoke:ui` ✅ PASS (Verified navigation to Core V2 and main components via test IDs).

## Files Changed
- `client/src/tabs/CoreV2Tab.jsx`
