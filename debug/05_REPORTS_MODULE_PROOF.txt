Reports Module Isolation Proof
==============================

1. Checklist
------------
[x] Created server/src/modules/reports
[x] Merged reportsV2 code into modules/reports
[x] Shimmed reportsV2 to preserve compatibility
[x] Merged legacy reportsController logic into modules/reports/controller.js
[x] Consolidated routes into modules/reports/routes.js
[x] Updated app.js to mount 'reports' module on both legacy and v2 prefixes
[x] Deleted legacy route/controller files
[x] Updated controller to use req.project (Context)

2. Endpoints Mapped (Preserved)
-------------------------------
Mounted at /api/v2/reports (via app.js mount):
- GET /summary
- GET /top-suppliers
- GET /top-customers
- GET /monthly-totals
- POST /pdf
- POST /pdf-pro
- GET /export

Mounted at /api/reports (via app.js mount):
- GET /suppliers
- GET /monthly
- GET /customers
- POST /pro-pdf

(Note: Due to unified routes, V2 endpoints are technically accessible via legacy prefix and vice versa, but all original paths work as expected.)

3. Smoke Test
-------------
PASS (v2.7 RBAC)
