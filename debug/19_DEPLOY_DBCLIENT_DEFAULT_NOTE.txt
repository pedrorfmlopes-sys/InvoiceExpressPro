MICRO-PATCH NOTE: DB_CLIENT DEFAULT
=======================================
Date: 2025-12-15

Objective:
Align default `DB_CLIENT` value in `scripts/deploy_runner.js` to 'sqlite' (previously 'sqlite3') to match project standards and `run_gate.js` configuration.

Changes:
- Modified `scripts/deploy_runner.js`:
  - `const DB_CLIENT = ENV.DB_CLIENT || 'sqlite';`

Verification:
- `npm run deploy:dry` output confirms:
  - `DB_CLIENT: sqlite` (in Configuration log)
  - Gate execution and steps successful.

Status:
PATCHED & VERIFIED.
